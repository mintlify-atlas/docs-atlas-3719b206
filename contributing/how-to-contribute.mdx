## Welcome Contributors

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VS Code! There are several ways you can contribute, beyond writing code. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how you can get involved in the VS Code open source project.

## Asking Questions

Have a question about VS Code? We encourage you to ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio-code) using the tag `visual-studio-code`.

<Note>
The active VS Code community on Stack Overflow will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.
</Note>

<Tip>
Instead of opening an issue for questions, Stack Overflow is the preferred channel as it:
- Reaches a broader community of developers
- Provides searchable answers for future users
- Keeps the issue tracker focused on bugs and feature requests
</Tip>

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome! The development team is available via several channels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stack Overflow">
    Ask questions using the `visual-studio-code` tag
  </Step>
  <Step title="GitHub Discussions">
    Connect with extension authors and discuss ideas
  </Step>
  <Step title="Social Media">
    Follow [@code](https://x.com/code) on Twitter for updates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Slack Community">
    Join the [VS Code Dev Community](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-community)
  </Step>
</Steps>

For more details, see the [Feedback Channels](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feedback-Channels) wiki page.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in VS Code? Do you have a feature request? Here's how to report your issue effectively.

### Identify Where to Report

The VS Code project is distributed across multiple repositories. Try to file the issue against the correct repository:

<Accordion title="Determine the Correct Repository">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Disable Extensions">
      Can you recreate the issue after [disabling all extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_disable-an-extension)? If the issue is caused by an extension, file the issue on that extension's repository.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Check Related Projects">
      Review the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) list to find the appropriate repository for your issue.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Core VS Code Issues">
      If it's a core editor issue, file it in the main [vscode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).
    </Step>
  </Steps>
</Accordion>

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before creating a new issue, search [open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) to see if the issue or feature request already exists.

<Tip>
Be sure to scan through the [most popular feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) as well.
</Tip>

If you find an existing issue:
- Make relevant comments
- Add your reaction using GitHub's reaction feature:
  - 👍 upvote
  - 👎 downvote

<Warning>
Use reactions instead of "+1" comments. This keeps the issue thread focused and makes it easier to gauge community interest.
</Warning>

### Writing Good Bug Reports

The built-in tool for reporting issues (accessible via **Help > Report Issue**) can help streamline this process by automatically providing:
- Your VS Code version
- All installed extensions
- System information
- Search results for similar existing issues

<Accordion title="Essential Information to Include">
  Every issue should include:

  - **Version of VS Code**: Include the exact version number
  - **Operating system**: Windows, macOS, or Linux with version
  - **List of extensions**: All installed extensions and their versions
  - **Reproducible steps**: Clear numbered steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue
  - **Expected vs actual behavior**: What you expected to see versus what actually happened
  - **Visual evidence**: Images, animations, or video showing the issue
  - **Code snippet**: Demonstrate the issue with code (must be copy-pasteable, not just a screenshot)
  - **Dev Tools Console errors**: Open via **Help > Toggle Developer Tools**
</Accordion>

### Writing Good Feature Requests

When requesting a new feature:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Single Request Per Issue">
    File a single issue per feature request. Don't enumerate multiple requests in one issue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Context">
    Explain the problem you're trying to solve and why existing features don't address it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe the Solution">
    Clearly describe how you envision the feature working.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Use Cases">
    Provide real-world scenarios where this feature would be beneficial.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Final Checklist

Before submitting your issue:

- [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is new
- [ ] Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions
- [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

<Note>
Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
</Note>

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the [issue tracking workflow](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking). Understanding this workflow helps you know what to expect and how to continue assisting throughout the process.

## Automated Issue Management

VS Code uses GitHub Actions to manage issues efficiently. These actions:

- Automatically close issues marked `info-needed` if there's no response in 7 days
- Automatically lock issues 45 days after they are closed
- Implement the [feature request pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issues-Triaging#managing-feature-requests)

<Tip>
If you believe the bot made a mistake, open a new issue and let the team know.
</Tip>
