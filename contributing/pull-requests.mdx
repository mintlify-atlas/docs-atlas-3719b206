## Prerequisites

Before creating a pull request:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Development Environment">
    Follow the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) guide to:
    - Fork and clone the repository
    - Install dependencies
    - Build from source
    - Run VS Code in development mode
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find or Create an Issue">
    Associate your PR with an existing issue, or create one first to discuss the proposed changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Branch">
    Create a new branch from `main` for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/issue-12345
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Before Submitting

### Code Quality Checklist

Ensure your code meets these requirements:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Follows Coding Guidelines">
    - Uses tabs for indentation (not spaces)
    - Follows naming conventions (PascalCase for types, camelCase for functions)
    - Includes JSDoc comments for public APIs
    - Externalizes user-facing strings with `nls.localize()`
    - Uses proper TypeScript types (avoids `any`)
    
    See [Coding Guidelines](/contributing/coding-guidelines) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Compiles Without Errors">
    Run the build to check for TypeScript compilation errors:
    ```bash
    yarn watch  # or npm run watch
    ```
    Fix all errors before submitting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Passes All Tests">
    Run the test suites to ensure nothing breaks:
    ```bash
    # Unit tests
    ./scripts/test.sh
    # or on Windows: .\scripts\test.bat
    
    # Integration tests
    ./scripts/test-integration.sh
    # or on Windows: .\scripts\test-integration.bat
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Includes Tests for Changes">
    Add new tests for:
    - New features
    - Bug fixes (reproduce the bug, then fix it)
    - Changes to existing behavior
    
    Place tests in the appropriate location:
    - Unit tests: `src/vs/*/test/` folders
    - Integration tests: `test/` folder or extension tests
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Passes Layering Check">
    Verify no architectural layer violations:
    ```bash
    npm run valid-layers-check
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Keep Code Up to Date

<Warning>
Ensure your code is up to date with the `main` branch before submitting.
</Warning>

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Rebase your feature branch
git checkout your-feature-branch
git rebase main
```

## Creating the Pull Request

### PR Title

Write a clear, concise title that describes what the PR does:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Examples">
    - Fix hover flickering in editor
    - Add support for workspace trust API
    - Improve performance of file search
    - Update TypeScript to 5.3
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bad Examples">
    - Fix bug (too vague)
    - Update (no context)
    - Changes (doesn't describe what changed)
    - WIP (work in progress should be marked as draft)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### PR Description

Provide a comprehensive description following the template:

```markdown
## Summary
<!-- Brief description of what this PR does -->

## Related Issues
<!-- Link to related issues using #issue-number -->

  - **Description of changes**: What was changed and why
  - **Testing instructions**: How reviewers can verify the changes
  - **Visual evidence**: Screenshots or videos for UI changes
</Accordion>

### Draft vs Ready

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Draft PR">
    Use draft PRs when:
    - Work is still in progress
    - You want early feedback
    - Tests are not yet passing
    
    Mark as draft when creating:
    ```
    Create pull request (dropdown) → Create draft pull request
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Ready PR">
    Mark as ready when:
    - All code is complete
    - Tests pass
    - Ready for final review
    - Can be merged after approval
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## PR Review Process

### What to Expect

Once you submit your PR:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automated Checks">
    CI/CD pipelines run automatically:
    - Build verification
    - Test execution
    - Code analysis
    - Layering checks
    
    <Tip>
    All checks must pass before the PR can be merged.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Team Review">
    VS Code team members will review your PR:
    - Code quality
    - Design decisions
    - Test coverage
    - Documentation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Feedback & Iteration">
    Address review feedback:
    - Make requested changes
    - Respond to questions
    - Push new commits
    
    <Note>
    Don't force-push after review starts - it makes it harder to see what changed.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approval & Merge">
    Once approved:
    - Maintainer will merge the PR
    - Changes will appear in the next VS Code release
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Response Time

<Tip>
The VS Code team reviews PRs as time permits. Larger changes may take longer to review. Be patient and responsive to feedback.
</Tip>

You can help speed up the process by:
- Keeping PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Providing clear descriptions and test instructions
- Responding promptly to review comments
- Following coding guidelines

## Responding to Feedback

### Making Changes

When reviewers request changes:

1. **Make the requested changes** in your local branch
2. **Commit the changes** with clear commit messages
3. **Push to your fork** - the PR updates automatically

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback: improve error handling"
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

<Warning>
Avoid force-pushing (`git push -f`) after reviewers have started their review. This makes it difficult to see what changed in response to feedback.
</Warning>

### Discussing Feedback

If you disagree with feedback or need clarification:

- **Ask questions**: Use PR comments to discuss
- **Explain your reasoning**: Share why you made certain choices
- **Be open to learning**: Maintainers know the codebase well
- **Stay professional**: Keep discussions respectful and constructive

<Accordion title="Example Discussion">
  Reviewer: "Consider using a Map instead of an object here for better performance."
  
  You: "Thanks for the suggestion! I chose an object because:
  1. The keys are always strings in this case
  2. The data set is small (< 10 items)
  3. An object is more ergonomic for this use case
  
  However, if you think a Map would be better for consistency with other parts of the codebase, I'm happy to change it."
  
  This shows you:
  - Considered the feedback
  - Explained your reasoning
  - Remained open to changing
</Accordion>

## Common Issues

### Build Failures

If CI builds fail:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="TypeScript Compilation Errors">
    ```bash
    # Check for type errors locally
    yarn watch
    ```
    Fix all compilation errors before pushing again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Failures">
    ```bash
    # Run tests locally
    ./scripts/test.sh
    
    # Run specific test
    ./scripts/test.sh --grep "test name"
    ```
    Ensure all tests pass in your local environment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Layering Violations">
    ```bash
    # Check for layer violations
    npm run valid-layers-check
    ```
    Fix any violations by adjusting imports or moving code.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Merge Conflicts">
    ```bash
    # Update from main and resolve conflicts
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git checkout your-feature-branch
    git rebase main
    # Resolve conflicts, then:
    git rebase --continue
    git push -f origin your-feature-branch
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### PR Not Getting Attention

If your PR hasn't received a review:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure All Checks Pass">
    Reviewers prioritize PRs with passing CI checks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check PR Size">
    Very large PRs take longer to review. Consider splitting into smaller ones.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Description">
    Make sure you've filled out the PR template completely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Be Patient">
    The team reviews as time permits. Avoid repeatedly pinging for reviews.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Keep PRs Focused

<Tip>
One PR should address one issue or feature. This makes reviews faster and reduces the chance of merge conflicts.
</Tip>

```
✅ Good: "Fix hover flickering in editor"
❌ Bad: "Fix hover flickering, update TypeScript, and refactor workspace code"
```

### Write Clear Commit Messages

Commit messages should explain the "why" not just the "what":

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Commit Messages">
    ```
    Fix hover flickering caused by rapid redraws
    
    The hover widget was being destroyed and recreated
    on every mousemove event, causing flickering.
    Now we reuse the same widget instance.
    
    Fixes #12345
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Poor Commit Messages">
    ```
    fix bug
    ```
    
    ```
    update code
    ```
    
    These provide no context about what changed or why.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Document Breaking Changes

<Warning>
If your PR introduces breaking changes, clearly document them in the description and consider if they're necessary.
</Warning>

Breaking changes should:
- Be discussed in the related issue first
- Include migration guidance
- Be clearly marked in the PR description

### Test Thoroughly

Before submitting:

1. **Manual testing**: Actually use the feature you built
2. **Automated tests**: Run the full test suite
3. **Edge cases**: Test unusual scenarios
4. **Performance**: Ensure no performance regressions

<Accordion title="Testing Checklist">
  - [ ] Feature works as expected
  - [ ] Existing features still work
  - [ ] All unit tests pass
  - [ ] All integration tests pass
  - [ ] No console errors or warnings
  - [ ] Works across different operating systems (if applicable)
  - [ ] Performance is acceptable
</Accordion>

## After Your PR is Merged

### Cleanup

Once merged, you can:

```bash
# Delete your local branch
git checkout main
git branch -d your-feature-branch

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete your-feature-branch

# Update your fork
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

### Track Your Contribution

Your changes will:
- Appear in the next VS Code release
- Be included in the release notes (for significant changes)
- Be attributed to you in the git history

<Tip>
Check the [release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) to see when your changes ship!
