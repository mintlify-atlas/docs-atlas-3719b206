description: 'Guidelines for triaging and managing issues in the VS Code repository'
---

## Overview

Issue triaging is the process of reviewing, organizing, and prioritizing issues in the VS Code repository. This guide explains how the VS Code team manages issues and how contributors can help with the triaging process.

<Note>
While primarily aimed at maintainers and regular contributors, understanding the triaging process helps all contributors know what to expect when they file issues or submit pull requests.
</Note>

## Issue Lifecycle

Every issue goes through a series of stages from creation to resolution:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Issue Created">
    A user reports a bug or requests a feature using the issue template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initial Triage">
    Team reviews the issue to:
    - Verify it's in the correct repository
    - Check for duplicates
    - Add appropriate labels
    - Request more information if needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Investigation">
    If it's a bug:
    - Reproduce the issue
    - Identify root cause
    - Assess severity and impact
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prioritization">
    Determine when to address:
    - Current milestone
    - Future milestone
    - Backlog
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution">
    Issue is addressed through:
    - Code fix (via PR)
    - Documentation update
    - Working as designed explanation
    - Won't fix decision
  </Step>
  <Step title="Closure">
    Issue is closed with appropriate reason and milestone.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Issue Labels

VS Code uses a comprehensive labeling system to categorize and track issues:

### Type Labels

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bug">
    **`bug`** - Something isn't working correctly
    
    Bugs are prioritized based on:
    - Severity (data loss, crashes, functional issues)
    - Impact (number of users affected)
    - Workaround availability
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Feature Request">
    **`feature-request`** - Request for new functionality
    
    Feature requests go through a specific pipeline:
    1. Community voting and discussion
    2. Team review and consideration
    3. Design and implementation planning
    4. Milestone assignment if approved
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Enhancement">
    **`enhancement`** - Improvement to existing functionality
    
    Different from features - enhances what already exists rather than adding something entirely new.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Question">
    **`question`** - General question or discussion
    
    <Warning>
    Questions should typically be asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio-code) instead of GitHub issues.

VS Code uses GitHub Actions to help manage the large volume of issues:

### Automated Actions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Info Needed Closure">
    **Auto-closes** issues marked `info-needed` after 7 days with no response.
    
    ```
    Issue closed due to no response to request for information.
    Please reopen if you can provide the requested details.
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Issue Locking">
    **Auto-locks** issues 45 days after closure to prevent necroposting.
    
    If you encounter the same issue, file a new one referencing the old one.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Feature Request Pipeline">
    Implements the [feature request pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issues-Triaging#managing-feature-requests):
    - Collects votes and feedback
    - Moves to appropriate stage
    - Notifies when status changes
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Duplicate Detection">
    Helps identify potential duplicates based on:
    - Similar titles
    - Similar content
    - Same labels
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
If you believe the bot made a mistake, open a new issue explaining the situation and referencing the affected issue.
</Note>

## Feature Request Pipeline

Feature requests follow a specific process to ensure community input:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Under Discussion">
    New feature request is opened and labeled `feature-request`.
    
    Community can:
    - Vote with 👍 reactions
    - Discuss use cases
    - Propose alternatives
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="2. Team Review">
    After sufficient discussion, team reviews:
    - Alignment with VS Code vision

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="4. Implementation">
    Once scheduled:
    - Issue assigned to milestone
    - Work begins (team or contributor)
    - PR submitted and reviewed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="5. Shipped">
    Feature ships in VS Code release:
    - Issue closed and referenced in release notes
    - Community notified
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Upvote feature requests with 👍 reactions on the original post, not with comments. This helps the team gauge interest more accurately.
</Tip>

## How to Help with Triaging

Community members can help with issue triaging:

### Reproducing Issues

<Accordion title="Verify Bug Reports">
  Help confirm bugs by:
  
  1. **Following reproduction steps** in the issue
  2. **Testing on your system** (note your OS/version)
  3. **Commenting with results**:
     ```
     I can confirm this issue on:
     - VS Code: 1.85.0
     - OS: macOS 14.1
     - Extensions: [list relevant extensions]
     
     [Additional details or observations]
     ```
  4. **Providing additional info** like screenshots or videos
</Accordion>

### Identifying Duplicates

<Accordion title="Find Duplicate Issues">
  Before filing an issue (or after you spot a new one):
  
  1. **Search existing issues** for similar problems
  2. **Check closed issues** - might have been fixed or rejected
  3. **Comment with links** if you find duplicates:
     ```
     This appears to be a duplicate of #12345
     ```
  4. **Don't close or label** - let maintainers confirm
</Accordion>

### Providing Additional Context

<Accordion title="Add Helpful Information">
  If you encounter the same issue:
  
  1. **Add your use case** - different perspectives help
  2. **Share workarounds** if you've found any
  3. **Provide code samples** that demonstrate the issue
  4. **Note related issues** that might be connected
  
  <Warning>
  Avoid "+1" comments. Use 👍 reactions instead.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

### Answering Questions

<Accordion title="Help Other Users">
  If you know the answer to someone's question:
  
  1. **Provide clear answers** with examples
  2. **Link to relevant docs** or issues
  3. **Suggest workarounds** if no direct solution exists
  4. **Direct to Stack Overflow** for general questions
  
  <Tip>
  Helping other users is one of the most valuable contributions you can make!

## Best Practices for Issue Reporters

### Writing Effective Bug Reports

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use the Issue Template">
    The template exists for a reason - it ensures you provide all necessary information:
    - VS Code version
    - Operating system
    - Reproduction steps
    - Expected vs actual behavior
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="One Issue Per Report">
    Don't combine multiple unrelated bugs or feature requests:
    
    ✅ Good: "File explorer crashes when renaming folders with special characters"
    
    ❌ Bad: "File explorer crashes, terminal font is wrong, and I'd like a new theme"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Search First">
    Before creating a new issue:
    - Search open issues
    - Check closed issues
    - Review [popular feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide Minimal Reproduction">
    Simplify the reproduction case:
    
    ```typescript
    // Good - minimal example
    const x: string = 123; // Type error not shown
    
    // Bad - complex example with irrelevant code
    [100 lines of unrelated code]
    const x: string = 123; // Type error not shown
    [100 more lines]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Visual Evidence">
    For UI issues, include:
    - Screenshots showing the problem
    - GIFs/videos demonstrating the issue
    - Before/after comparisons
    
    <Tip>
    Use built-in screen recording (Windows: Win+G, macOS: Cmd+Shift+5)
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Responding to Triage

When team members request information:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Respond Promptly">
    Provide requested information within 7 days to prevent auto-closure.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Be Thorough">
    Answer all questions in the request, not just some.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Format Clearly">
    Use code blocks, screenshots, and clear explanations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stay Subscribed">
    Don't unsubscribe from your own issues - you may need to provide more info.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Issue Closure

Issues may be closed for various reasons:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fixed">
    Issue resolved in a merged PR.
    
    Check the linked PR and milestone to see when the fix will ship.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Duplicate">
    Another issue already tracks this.
    
    Follow the linked duplicate for updates.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Working as Designed">
    Behavior is intentional.
    
    Explanation provided for why it works this way.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Won't Fix">
    Team decided not to implement.
    
    Reasoning provided (conflicts with vision, too complex, etc.).
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="No Response">
    Reporter didn't provide requested information.
    
    Can be reopened if information is provided later.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Caused by Extension">
    Issue is with an extension, not VS Code core.
    
    File issue on the extension's repository instead.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Closed doesn't mean rejected. Many issues are closed as duplicates of other open issues, or are closed when fixed and scheduled for a future release.
</Note>
