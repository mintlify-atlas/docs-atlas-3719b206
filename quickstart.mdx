    <Note>
      For detailed installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](/installation).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open a Project">
    Start working with your code by opening a folder or file.
    
    **Open a folder:**
    1. Click **File** > **Open Folder** (or `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+K Cmd+O` on macOS)
    2. Select your project folder
    3. VS Code will load your project and show the file explorer on the left
    
    **Open a file:**
    - Click **File** > **Open File** (or `Ctrl+O` / `Cmd+O`)
    - Select any file to start editing
    
    <Tip>
      You can also drag and drop folders or files directly into VS Code.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit Your Code">
    VS Code provides powerful editing features out of the box.
    
    **IntelliSense:**
    - Start typing to see smart code completions
    - Press `Ctrl+Space` to trigger IntelliSense manually
    - Get inline documentation for functions and methods
    
    **Quick Navigation:**
    - `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P` - Quick Open: Jump to any file
    - `Ctrl+Shift+O` / `Cmd+Shift+O` - Go to Symbol: Navigate within a file
    - `F12` - Go to Definition: Jump to where something is defined
    - `Shift+F12` - Find All References: See all uses of a symbol
    
    **Multi-cursor Editing:**
    - `Alt+Click` / `Option+Click` - Add cursor at clicked position
    - `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down` / `Cmd+Option+Up/Down` - Add cursor above/below
    - `Ctrl+D` / `Cmd+D` - Select next occurrence
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Integrated Terminal">
    Access your command line without leaving the editor.
    
    1. Press `` Ctrl+` `` or click **Terminal** > **New Terminal**
    2. Run any command in your project directory
    3. Create multiple terminals with the + button
    4. Split terminals with the split icon
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Terminal Commands
    # Navigate and run your project
    npm install
    npm run dev
    
    # Run tests
    npm test
    
    # Git commands
    git status
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run and Debug">
    Debug your code with breakpoints and an interactive debugger.
    
    **Quick Start:**
    1. Open a file you want to debug
    2. Click in the left margin to set a breakpoint (red dot appears)
    3. Press `F5` to start debugging
    4. VS Code will prompt you to select a debug configuration
    
    **Debug Controls:**
    - `F5` - Continue / Start
    - `F10` - Step Over
    - `F11` - Step Into
    - `Shift+F11` - Step Out
    - `Shift+F5` - Stop
    
    <Note>
      For Node.js projects, VS Code can debug without any configuration. For other languages, you may need to install an extension.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Extensions">
    Extend VS Code with language support, themes, and tools.
    
    1. Click the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
    2. Search for the extension you need
    3. Click **Install**
    
    **Popular Extensions:**
    - **Python** - Rich Python language support
    - **ESLint** - JavaScript and TypeScript linting
    - **Prettier** - Code formatter
    - **GitLens** - Supercharge Git capabilities
    - **Live Share** - Real-time collaborative editing
    
    <Tip>
      Extensions run in separate processes and won't slow down your editor.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
