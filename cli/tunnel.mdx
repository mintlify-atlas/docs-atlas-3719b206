title: Remote Tunnels
description: Access your development environment from anywhere with VS Code Remote Tunnels
---

VS Code Remote Tunnels provide secure, authenticated access to your development machine from anywhere in the world. You can connect to your remote machine through vscode.dev or the VS Code desktop application without complex SSH or VPN configurations.

## Overview

Remote Tunnels use Microsoft Dev Tunnels technology to create a secure connection between your local machine and the VS Code server. This allows you to:

- Access your development environment from any device with a browser
- Work on your home/office machine while traveling
- Collaborate with others by sharing access to your machine
- Develop on remote machines without SSH port forwarding
- Use VS Code's full feature set remotely

<Note>
Remote Tunnels require authentication with either a Microsoft or GitHub account.
</Note>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a tunnel">
    On your development machine, run:
    ```bash
    code tunnel
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Follow the prompts to log in with your Microsoft or GitHub account. You'll be given a device code to enter on a web page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name your machine (optional)">
    Give your machine a memorable name, or let the CLI generate one randomly:
    ```bash
    code tunnel --name my-dev-machine
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect remotely">
    Open [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) in any browser and connect to your tunnel, or use VS Code desktop with the Remote Tunnels extension.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Tunnels

### Basic Tunnel

Start a tunnel with default settings:

```bash
code tunnel
```

This will:
1. Prompt you to log in (if not already authenticated)
2. Generate a random machine name (or prompt for one)
3. Start the tunnel server
4. Display the URL to access your machine

### Named Tunnel

Create a tunnel with a specific name:

```bash
code tunnel --name my-desktop
```

<Note>
Machine names must be unique within your account and can only contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.
</Note>

### Random Name

Generate a random machine name automatically:

```bash
code tunnel --random-name
```

Useful for:
- Temporary development environments
- CI/CD runners
- Testing scenarios

### Prevent Sleep

Keep your machine awake while the tunnel is running:

```bash
code tunnel --no-sleep
```

This prevents the system from going to sleep, which would disconnect the tunnel.

### Accept License Terms

Skip the interactive license acceptance prompt:

```bash
code tunnel --accept-server-license-terms
```

Required for:
- Automated scripts
- Non-interactive environments
- CI/CD pipelines

## Authentication

### Login

Authenticate with the tunnel service:

```bash
code tunnel user login
```

You'll be prompted to:
1. Choose an authentication provider (Microsoft or GitHub)
2. Visit a URL and enter a device code
3. Authorize the application

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitHub">
    ```bash
    code tunnel user login --provider github
    ```
    
    Authenticate using your GitHub account. This is recommended for developers who primarily use GitHub.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Microsoft">
    ```bash
    code tunnel user login --provider microsoft
    ```
    
    Authenticate using your Microsoft account (work, school, or personal).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Token-Based Authentication

For automated workflows, you can provide access tokens directly:

```bash
code tunnel user login --provider github --access-token YOUR_TOKEN
```

Or use environment variables:

```bash
export VSCODE_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
export VSCODE_CLI_REFRESH_TOKEN="your_refresh_token"
code tunnel user login --provider github
```

<Warning>
Never commit access tokens to version control. Use secure secret management for production deployments.
</Warning>

### Check Authentication Status

Verify which account is currently logged in:

```bash
code tunnel user show
```

Output:
```
logged in with provider github
```

### Logout

Remove stored credentials:

```bash
code tunnel user logout
```

## Managing Tunnels

### Check Status

Get information about running tunnels:

```bash
code tunnel status
```

Returns JSON output:
```json
{
  "tunnel": {
    "name": "my-dev-machine",
    "cluster": "usw2",
    "id": "abc123...",
    "status": "running"
  },
  "service_installed": false
}
```

### Rename Tunnel

Change the name of your machine:

```bash
code tunnel rename new-machine-name
```

This updates the machine name associated with the port forwarding service.

### Restart Tunnel

Restart a running tunnel:

```bash
code tunnel restart
```

Useful after:
- Configuration changes
- Network connectivity issues
- Extension updates

### Stop Tunnel

Stop any running tunnel on the system:

```bash
code tunnel kill
```

This gracefully shuts down the tunnel server.

### Unregister Machine

Remove this machine's association with the tunnel service:

```bash
code tunnel unregister
```

<Warning>
This removes the machine from your account. You'll need to create a new tunnel to connect again.
</Warning>

### Clean Up Inactive Tunnels

Delete all tunnel servers that are not currently running:

```bash
code tunnel prune
```

This frees up disk space by removing:
- Old server installations
- Unused server data
- Cached files

## Running as a System Service

For always-on tunnel access, install the tunnel as a system service. The service runs in the background and starts automatically on system boot.

### Install Service

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure you're logged in">
    ```bash
    code tunnel user login
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install the service">
    ```bash
    code tunnel service install
    ```
    
    Or with a specific name:
    ```bash
    code tunnel service install --name my-server
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Accept license terms">
    ```bash
    code tunnel service install --accept-server-license-terms
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Service installation requires administrator/root privileges on most systems.
</Note>

### Platform-Specific Service Management

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux (systemd)">
    The CLI creates a systemd service:
    
    ```bash
    # Check service status
    systemctl status code-tunnel
    
    # View logs
    journalctl -u code-tunnel -f
    
    # Restart service
    sudo systemctl restart code-tunnel
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="macOS (launchd)">
    The CLI creates a launchd service:
    
    ```bash
    # Check service status
    launchctl list | grep code-tunnel
    
    # View logs
    tail -f ~/Library/Logs/code-tunnel.log
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">
    The CLI creates a Windows service:
    
    ```powershell
    # Check service status
    Get-Service vscode-tunnel
    
    # View logs
    code tunnel service log
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### View Service Logs

Display logs from the running service:

```bash
code tunnel service log
```

This shows:
- Connection events
- Error messages
- Performance metrics
- Authentication status

### Uninstall Service

Remove the tunnel service:

```bash
code tunnel service uninstall
```

This:
1. Stops the running service
2. Removes service configuration
3. Cleans up service files

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Server Data Directory

Specify where server data is stored:

```bash
code tunnel --server-data-dir ~/.custom-vscode-server
```

### Custom Extensions Directory

Use a custom location for extensions:

```bash
code tunnel --extensions-dir ~/.custom-extensions
```

### Pre-install Extensions

Install extensions when the tunnel starts:

```bash
code tunnel --install-extension ms-python.python --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
```

### Reconnection Grace Time

Set how long the server waits for reconnection (in seconds):

```bash
code tunnel --reconnection-grace-time 7200  # 2 hours
```

Default is 10800 seconds (3 hours).

### Using Existing Tunnels

Connect to an existing tunnel with specific credentials:

<Note>
These are advanced options primarily for internal or debugging use.
</Note>

```bash
code tunnel --tunnel-id TUNNEL_ID --cluster CLUSTER --host-token TOKEN
```

## Connecting to Tunnels

### Via Browser (vscode.dev)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open vscode.dev">
    Navigate to [https://vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) in any modern browser.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Remote Tunnels">
    In the left sidebar, click the Remote Explorer icon or use the Command Palette (`F1`) and search for "Remote Tunnels".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sign in">
    Sign in with the same account you used to create the tunnel.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your machine">
    Choose your machine from the list of available tunnels.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start coding">
    You now have full access to your remote development environment!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via VS Code Desktop

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Remote Tunnels extension">
    Install the "Remote - Tunnels" extension from the marketplace.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Remote Explorer">
    Click the Remote Explorer icon in the Activity Bar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect to tunnel">
    Select "Remote Tunnels" from the dropdown and click on your machine.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via VS Code Insiders

VS Code Insiders has built-in tunnel support:

```bash
code-insiders --remote tunnel://my-machine-name
```

## Port Forwarding

The tunnel automatically handles port forwarding for development servers.

### How It Works

1. Start a web server on your remote machine (e.g., `localhost:3000`)
2. VS Code detects the server automatically
3. A forwarded URL is created (e.g., `https://abc123.tunnel.dev:3000`)
4. Access your app from anywhere via the forwarded URL

### Manual Port Forwarding

You can also manually forward ports:

1. Open the Command Palette (`F1`)
2. Run "Forward a Port"
3. Enter the port number
4. Access via the provided URL

## Security Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication & Authorization">
    - All tunnel connections require authentication
    - Only you can access your tunnels (unless explicitly shared)
    - Connections use TLS encryption
    - Tokens are stored securely in the system keychain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Network Security">
    - Tunnels use encrypted WebSocket connections
    - No inbound firewall rules required
    - All traffic goes through Microsoft's Dev Tunnels service
    - Connection tokens are SHA-256 hashed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Privacy">
    - Your code stays on your machine
    - Only connection metadata passes through the tunnel service
    - You control what is accessible remotely
    - Can be completely unregistered at any time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Best Practices">
    - Use strong authentication (GitHub/Microsoft)
    - Don't share access tokens
    - Regularly rotate credentials
    - Use `--no-sleep` judiciously (power consumption)
    - Monitor active connections via `code tunnel status`
    - Unregister unused tunnels
  </Accordion>
