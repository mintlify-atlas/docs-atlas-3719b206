description: Overview of the Visual Studio Code Command Line Interface (CLI)
---

The Visual Studio Code CLI (`code`) is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to control and interact with VS Code from the terminal. It provides functionality for opening files and folders, managing extensions, creating remote tunnels, and much more.

## What is the VS Code CLI?

The VS Code CLI is a Rust-based command-line interface that serves as the entry point for launching and controlling Visual Studio Code. It can:

- Launch VS Code with specific files, folders, or workspaces
- Manage extensions (install, uninstall, list)
- Create secure remote tunnels for accessing your machine from anywhere
- Run a local web version of VS Code
- Switch between different VS Code versions (stable, insiders, or specific versions)
- Configure editor settings and troubleshoot issues

<Note>
The CLI is designed to work with both standalone installations and integrated VS Code installations.

## Basic Usage

The basic syntax for using the VS Code CLI is:

```bash
code [options] [paths...]
```

### Opening Files and Folders

<CodeGroup>
```bash Open a file
code myfile.txt
```

```bash Open a folder
code /path/to/project
```

```bash Open multiple files
code file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

```bash Read from stdin
echo "Hello World" | code -
```
</CodeGroup>

### Quick Examples

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a file at a specific line">
    ```bash
    code --goto myfile.txt:42:5
    ```
    Opens `myfile.txt` at line 42, column 5.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compare two files">
    ```bash
    code --diff file1.txt file2.txt
    ```
    Opens a diff view comparing the two files.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install an extension">
    ```bash
    code ext install ms-python.python
    ```
    Installs the Python extension.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a tunnel">
    ```bash
    code tunnel
    ```
    Creates a secure tunnel to access your machine remotely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Command Categories

The CLI is organized into several main command categories:

### Core Commands

- **No subcommand** - Launch VS Code with files/folders
- `status` - Print process usage and diagnostics
- `version` - Manage VS Code versions

### Extension Commands

- `ext list` - List installed extensions
- `ext install` - Install extensions
- `ext uninstall` - Uninstall extensions
- `ext update` - Update extensions

### Tunnel Commands

- `tunnel` - Create and manage remote tunnels
- `tunnel service` - Manage tunnel as a system service
- `tunnel user` - Manage authentication for tunnels

### Web Commands

- `serve-web` - Run a local web version of VS Code

<Note>
For detailed information about each command, see the [Commands Reference](/cli/commands) page.
</Note>

## Global Options

These options can be used with any command:

<ParamField path="--verbose" type="boolean">
  Print verbose output (implies --wait)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--log" type="string">
  Log level to use. Values: `off`, `critical`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--cli-data-dir" type="string">
  Directory where CLI metadata should be stored
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--disable-telemetry" type="boolean">
  Disable telemetry for the current command
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--telemetry-level" type="string">
  Sets the initial telemetry level. Values: `off`, `crash`, `error`, `all`
</ParamField>

## Architecture

The VS Code CLI is built with:

- **Language**: Rust
- **Binary name**: `code` (or `code-cli` internally)
- **Command parsing**: clap library for robust CLI argument parsing
- **Async runtime**: tokio for asynchronous operations
- **Tunneling**: Microsoft Dev Tunnels for secure remote access

## Output Formats

Many commands support both text and JSON output formats:

```bash Text output (default)
code tunnel status
```

```bash JSON output
code tunnel status --format json
```

## Environment Variables

The CLI respects several environment variables:

- `VSCODE_CLI_DATA_DIR` - Override the CLI data directory
- `VSCODE_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Provide access token for authentication
- `VSCODE_CLI_REFRESH_TOKEN` - Provide refresh token for authentication
- `VSCODE_CLI_REQUIRE_TOKEN` - Require token for command shell connections
- `VSCODE_CLI_NONINTERACTIVE` - Disable interactive prompts
- `NO_COLOR` - Disable colored output
